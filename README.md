# Data-Mining Projects

Data mining is the process of discovering interesting patterns from massive amounts of data. As a knowledge discovery process, it typically involves data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation, pattern discovery, pattern evaluation, and knowledge presentation.

I will have different projects concerning data mining methods and techniques used to guide this discovery process and support the process of decision making.

* Data preprocessing
* Pattern mining
* Cluster Analysis 
* Classification
